# Project Description

This is a simple recipe site using React. I recently started learning React so wanted to give it a shot in a project. This project will include: useState, useEffect, and useParams. I will be using the "Recipes by API-Ninjas" API to get the recipes.

The project will contain a search field where the user can search for recipes that will appear below the search filed. The user will then be able to click on a recipe and get redirected to it's page, where the the recipe's ingredients and instructions will be visible.
