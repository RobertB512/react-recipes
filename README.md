# Project Description

This is a simple recipe site using React. I recently started learning React so wanted to give it a shot in a project. This project includes: simple useState, useEffect, and useParams.

The project will contain a search field where the user can search for recipes (comming from the "Recipe by API-Ninjas" API by "API Ninjas"), that will appear below the search filed. The user will then be able to click on a recipe and be redirected to it's page, where the user will be able to view the recipe's ingredients and instructions.
